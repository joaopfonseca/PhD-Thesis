\chapter{Moving Forward}~\label{chp:moving_forward}

% Focus of chapter 2 and how it links to G-SMOTENC
In Chapter~\ref{chp:data-augmentation-trends} we studied the state-of-the-art
in data augmentation algorithms, which was necessary to proceed to subsequent
steps of the work plan. Based on these findings, in
Chapter~\ref{chp:kmeans-smote} we used an oversampling method to address a
know limitation of imbalanced learning in LULC\@. An additional limitation we
found in oversampling methods was the lack of models capable of addressing
datasets with both metric and non-metric features. We plan to address this
limitation by modifying a state-of-the-art oversampling method, based on RQ4
as described in Subsection~\ref{sec:main_objectives}. This work will be added
as a new Chapter between Chapters~\ref{chp:data-augmentation-trends}
and~\ref{chp:kmeans-smote}.

% Focus of chapter 4 and 5 and how they introduced individual elements to AL,
% the next step is SAD-Learning: merging the different contributions while
% adding other hybrid learning methods to leverage more information from
% unlabeled data
In Chapters~\ref{chp:al-generator-lulc}
and~\ref{chp:active-learning-augmentation} we modify the AL framework as a
means to address RQ3. However, the work presented can be further enriched with
the application of other methods that leverage information from unlabeled
data, specifically semi-supervised and self-supervised learning techniques.
This work is also under development and is intended to follow
Chapter~\ref{chp:active-learning-augmentation}.

The last chapter will close the thesis with the conclusions, discussion of the
proposed research questions and recommendations for future work based on the
results presented in previous chapters.
